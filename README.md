# Patterns-In-Bank-Data
Using Apriori Rules algorithm to find the frequent patterns, called rules, in the bank dataset. To determine which rules apply to most data, you will analyze the metrics for ranking rules. Since the algorithm works only on categorical data, you will revisit the discretization data preprocessing filter.
